**Focus**
- Generate **synthetic** sentences around trials and clinical mentions.
- Train simple baselines; report precision/recall and error types.

**Stack**
- Python, spaCy/HF token classification (lightweight setup)
- Reproducible notebooks and seeds

**Lessons**
- Synthetic data helps kick-start models when real data is limited, but careful prompt design matters a lot.

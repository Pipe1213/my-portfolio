Creation of a Synthetic Dataset for French Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Clinical Trial Texts

## Goal
Develop a synthetic French dataset to improve Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the medical domain, focusing on clinical-trial eligibility criteria. The project explored cross-lingual transfer and synthetic data generation to overcome the scarcity of annotated resources in French.

## Overview
We designed a multilingual pipeline that automatically translated and annotated English clinical-trial texts into French. The system combined neural machine translation with XLM-RoBERTa fine-tuning to produce high-quality NER labels for French data, enabling downstream NLP research and medical-text understanding.

## Approach

- Started from the CHIA dataset of English clinical-trial criteria and selected non-overlapping medical entities.
- Translated all sentences from English → French using the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr model and evaluated translation quality with BLEU, TER, and METEOR, confirming superior performance to T5 and GPT-4 baselines.
- Fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base for token classification on the English data using Hugging Face Transformers and validated its cross-lingual performance on MultiNERD, achieving strong generalization to French.
- Used the fine-tuned model to automatically annotate the translated French corpus, producing the first synthetic French NER dataset for clinical trials.
- Implemented all processing in Python and Jupyter, with Transformers, Datasets, Torch, NLTK, and Weights & Biases for training tracking.

## Results & Impact

- Demonstrated that a model trained purely on English data can effectively perform cross-lingual NER on French, with consistent precision/recall trends on MultiNERD.
- Generated and released a new open-source dataset on Hugging Face: [JavierLopetegui/chia-ner-french](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JavierLopetegui/chia-ner-french).
- Validated translation reliability and entity consistency, showing that synthetic annotation can significantly expand resources for under-represented languages.

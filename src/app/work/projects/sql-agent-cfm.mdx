**Goal.** Help analysts query internal datasets using natural language, safely and efficiently.

**What I built**
- **Plan/Execute agent** (ReWoo-style planning) that decomposes requests and selects tools.
- **RAG over Oracle schemas** with table summaries, column descriptions, and example rows (Chroma).
- **Example retrieval** to guide few-shot SQL generation.
- **Evaluation harness**: label-free production checks + bootstrap confidence intervals; trace analysis.

**Stack**
- LangGraph, LangChain, Oracle SQL, Python
- ChromaDB (schema & example store), BM25 + embeddings
- Streamlit UI; telemetry & traces

**Takeaways**
- Retrieval quality (schema + examples) drives SQL accuracy more than raw LLM size.
- Divide-and-conquer + explicit reasoning steps reduce invalid SQL by a large margin.

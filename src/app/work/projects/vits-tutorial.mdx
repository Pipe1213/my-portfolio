## Goal
Train and document a full VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech) model from scratch using custom datasets, enabling others to reproduce high-quality speech synthesis with minimal setup. The focus was on understanding and extending the VITS architecture to new datasets and languages.

## Overview
This project provides a complete step-by-step training pipeline for VITS, a state-of-the-art end-to-end speech synthesis model that unifies variational autoencoding, adversarial training, and normalizing flows. It guides users through dataset preparation, model configuration, and training procedures — from preprocessing text and phonemes to generating final audio outputs.

## Approach

- Implemented a reproducible training workflow using Python and PyTorch, including custom preprocessing routines for dataset normalization, phoneme extraction, and alignment.
- Built Monotonic Alignment Search with Cython to improve text-audio alignment efficiency and stability.
- Configured training for both single-speaker (LJ Speech) and multi-speaker (VCTK) datasets, adapting configuration files and speaker embeddings.
- Designed clear dataset-formatting rules, allowing easy adaptation to any language or corpus.
- Integrated Hugging Face Transformers for tokenization and phoneme handling, enabling multilingual flexibility.
- Provided inference scripts and notebooks to generate audio directly from text once models are trained.

## Results & Impact

- Trained multiple VITS configurations achieving natural and expressive TTS quality.
- Released a public repository with clear documentation for training, evaluation, and inference, helping others reproduce or adapt VITS to their data.
- Provided trained model checkpoints and inference demos on Hugging Face for open research access.

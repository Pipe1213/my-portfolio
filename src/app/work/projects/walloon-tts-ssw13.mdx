**Idea.** Build a Walloon text-to-speech system leveraging **cross-lingual pretraining**.

**Highlights**
- **VITS** model initialized with French pretraining; fine-tuned on Walloon data.
- Evaluated with **objective metrics** + **MOS bootstrap** for uncertainty.
- Error analysis on pauses and prosody; ablations on grapheme/phoneme pipelines.

**Notes**
- Future: better pause modeling and more robust prosody controls.
